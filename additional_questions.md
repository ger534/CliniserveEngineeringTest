Question 1 - How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?\
    
    Start time: 6 o'clock saturday nighh from march 13\
    
Question 2 - What alternative approaches/solutions to the user story did you consider when engineering your solution? \
             What benefits/downsides would they have had compared to the selected solution?\

    My solution is not mobile-friendly. It can seem on mobiles but is not visually pleasurable\
    Responsive\

Question 3 - What additional features/improvements do you think could help the customer gain more value from your application?\

    Notifications when the API updates the data\

Question 4 - Where do you see issues in your code that might cause issues in the future? How would you monitor the performance of your app?\

    The table could be a separate components, being inside Cases.js is not really the best way to handle the user interface.

Question 5 - How would you improve the API that you just used or its documentation?\

    The API went down a few times during development, I would like to improve the availability more than "run it locally" as the documentation advises in case of problems
    Around 2 AM its returning {} data, when this happens the site goes a little bit crazy. I sopposed that the 90 days were going to come if the request was ok, but sometimes the information is {}.
    Whatever causes this in the API is probablely related to the actualizacition process and it should be fix.


Question 6 - What did you think about this test? How interesting was it for you? How would you recommend us to improve the test?\

    It is awesome to think that a piece of code so simple like making a API request and drawing a chart, can help so much the front line agaisnt viruses such as COVID=19\
